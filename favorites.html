<h1>My Favorite Song</h1>
<h2>"Once and for all" Lauren Daigle</h2>
<p>God I give You all I can today
<br>These scattered ashes that I hid away
<br>I lay them all at Your feet<br>

<br>From the corners of my deepest shame
<br>The empty places where I've worn Your name
<br>Show me the love I say I believe<br>

<br>Oh Help me to lay it down
<br>Oh Lord I lay it down<br>

<br>Oh let this be where I die
<br>My lord with thee crucified
<br>Be lifted high as my Kingdom's fall
<br>Once and for all, once and for all<br>

<br>There is victory in my Saviors los
<br>And In the crimson flowing from the cross
<br>Pour over me, pour over me yes<br>

<br>Oh let this be where I die
<br>My lord with thee crucified
<br>Be lifted high as my Kingdom's fall
<br>Once and for all, once and for all<br>

<br>Oh Lord I lay it down
<br>Oh Lord I lay it down
<br>Help me to lay it down
<br>Oh Lord I lay it down <br>

<br>Oh let this be where I die
<br>My Lord with thee crucified
<br>Be lifted high as my Kingdom's fall
<br>Once and for all<br>

<br>Once and for all
<br>Oh once and for all<br>
Once and for all </p>
